Search Engine Content Editor OSX

I needed an Editor where i can check how much SEO keywords I've used in my text
Therefore I built this little App (Quick and Dirty) where I can import a Keyword List (1 Keyword per Line) and edit my text.
The "HTML" Tab just displays the <style> and <body> tags to copy it to my HTML File (acutally i put them right now in my Middleman Project as Language Content)
The Status-Text just displays the overall used words, overall used keywords and a density percantage

BTW: Code is in Apple's new Language Swift
